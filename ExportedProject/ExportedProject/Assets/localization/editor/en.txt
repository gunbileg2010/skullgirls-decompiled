I still hide knives in my shoes thanks to your last lesson!","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D4":"If you weren't 90% knives already, I'm sure they'd be effective.\n\nI\u2019m here because the Medici have matters that require a particularly... violent performance.","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D5":"As part of the Cirque des Cartes, each of you knows how to handle a crowd.\n\nBut, we only have one open position, so you'll have to prove you're the best.","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D6":"You think you\u2019re up for this, Feng? \n\nI mean, can you even lift a trapeze with those noodle arms of yours?","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D7":"Pssshhh, whatever Bella. \n\nThis\u2019ll be fun!","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D8":"Listen up, punks.\n\nThree tests, one winner.

Pass, and all these will be yours...","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D9":"...but that\u2019s ONLY if any of you make it in the first place. \n\nSo without further ado, Hubrecht here shall start off by testing your physical prowess.","SD_Vignette05_C1_Intro_D10":"Enjoy the obstacle course! \n\nI designed it myself, ohohoho!","SD_Vignette05_C1_M1_D1":"I see Beatrix\u2019s magic tricks have improved.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M1_D2":"You should come to one of her shows sometime. \n\nShe can do things with her Cloak of Damocles that would, with the deepest respect, blow your mind.

That the best you got? I\u2019ve had audiences tougher than you!","SD_Vignette05_C1_M1_D10":"...Interesting.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D2":"Woohoooooooooo! DONE!\n\nThat was easy!","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D3":"Is this one new?","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D4":"No, Feng was here the last time you came.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D5":"Must not have made an impression.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D6":"She's probably preoccupied - her family back in the Dragon Empire is depending on her. \n\nGive her time, I'm sure she'll adjust.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D7":"How exotic. What\u2019s with the birds?","SD_Vignette05_C1_M2_D8":"They're a... a long story. \n\nLet's just say, strange ghosts are drawn to bad feng shui...","SD_Vignette05_C1_M3_D1":"And of course you remember Cerebella.","SD_Vignette05_C1_M3_D2":"Ah, yes.

Thank you, Bella! It's good to have such caring friends.\n\nBut it would take more than that fall to break THESE arms. They're fortified by years of hugs!","SD_Vignette05_C1_Outro_D1":"So what do you think? See anything you like?","SD_Vignette05_C1_Outro_D2":"Skill-wise, they all bring something to the table. \n\nOn the other hand...","SD_Vignette05_C1_Outro_D3":"Beatrix wears her ambitions on her sleeve. Feng is preoccupied and hesitates too much.","SD_Vignette05_C1_Outro_D4":"Cerebella may be the strongest, but I don't think she's ready for what the job demands.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D1":"I see you\u2019ve all managed to pass the first round. Good. \n\nThe more of you that succeed, the more difficult the final round will be.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D2":"I\u2019ve asked your fellow performer, Taliesin to provide the next trial. \n\nThe last focused on your physical tools. This one will challenge your mind.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D3":"The Medici need more than just physical prowess. \n\nWe want someone who can think on their feet. Improvise. Adapt.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D4":"The test is simple. I have before me three boxes, one for each of you. \n\nEach contains a fragile prize -- all I need is for you to give me what\u2019s inside. ","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D5":"Each box has six sides. Each side requires you solve a dastardly puzzle (of my own design). \n\nSix sides. Six minutes. ","SD_Vignette05_C2_Intro_D6":"Beatrix. The clock starts... NOW!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D2":"Ugh, useless!\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with being an enforcer anyway?!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D4":"If only SOMEONE had a CLOAK filled with MAGIC TOOLS...","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D6":"Oh, right! Let's see here... GOT IT!\n\nWow - a Renoir Egg! These things are priceless!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D7":"And with three minutes to spare. Impressive.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D8":"Haha! Beat that, Bella!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M1_D9":"Cerebella, your clock starts... NOW!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D2":"Cerebella, you have one minute remaining.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D3":"What?! That can\u2019t\u2026 I just\u2026 \n\nAw hell, screw it!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D5":"C\u2019mon Vice-Versa! We can do this! Hnnnggghhhh!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D7":"HAHA! DID IT!\n\nOh... I guess mine was broken... this whole time?","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D8":"Very good, Cerebella.\n\nAs you no doubt inferred, I merely noted it was fragile, I never said you had to give me the egg in one piece. \n\nQuite astute.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M2_D9":"...yeah! Astute, that\u2019s me! \n\nAlways thinking ahead, yup! Yessir! ","SD_Vignette05_C2_M3_D2":"Pfft, these puzzles are a joke.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M3_D3":"My, my. Cute AND smart. Keep this up and you\u2019ll set a new record today.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M3_D4":"Hah, um... thanks?\n\nIt's just obvious if you look at it algorithmically.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M3_D5":"Grrr... there\u2019s no telling how good she\u2019ll be at the next trial. \n\nI have to do something...","SD_Vignette05_C2_M3_D7":"Hehehehehe.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D1":"What?! But I finished WAY faster than everyone else!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D2":"I'm sorry, my dear. \n\nThe rules are that I need you to give me the prize inside.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D3":"But it was empty!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D4":"Now now, don't blame poor Taliesin for your incompetance.\n\nYou lost, it happens. Step aside.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D5":"SHE made the Egg disappear somehow! I would\u2019ve passed if she hadn\u2019t interfered!\n\nIt's not fair!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D6":"You think people will play fair when you\u2019re working for the Medici? \n\nThink again.","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D7":"It\u2019s not like you would\u2019ve won in the end anyway. In fact you should thank me, I just made things easier for you.

Grrraghh!!!","SD_Vignette05_C2_M4_D10":"Hey! Feng, what're you... ow! Stop!!","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D1":"OK, OK... *pants* I\u2019m sorry\u2026 about... the teasing.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D2":"Just... promise me... if you win this thing... you\u2019re not going to turn into Beatrix.","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D3":"Ha, like I\u2019d ever want to have THAT hair!","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D4":"I\u2019m serious! She\u2019s a little ball of envious rage who doesn\u2019t care about anyone except herself!","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D5":"Hey! I'm nothing like Beatrix - I totally care about people!","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D6":"Yeah, but\u2026 you want the fame too. You always talk about being \"center stage\". \n\nI know you do, and that\u2019s fine, but just\u2026 be careful, alright? ","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D7":"Alright, alright. \n\nBut ONLY because I\u2019m terrified of your birds haunting me if I ever really ticked you off!","SD_Vignette05_C2_Outro_D8":"Haha, as you should be! \n\nNow go beat Beatrix!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D1":"Well, well. This is it. Our final trial: Beatrix vs Cerebella. \n\nAh, and I see our VIP has finally arrived.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D2":"Yes, well I would\u2019ve come sooner, but you know how business is. \n\nThere\u2019s always one more person that needs resolving. ","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D3":"Vitale! Perfect timing! \n\nYou\u2019re about to see me win it all!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D4":"I do love your enthusiasm, my dear.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D5":"Enough games. Now it's time for a REAL fight.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D6":"The rules are simple: Win by KOing your opponent, or by knocking them out of the ring.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Intro_D7":"FIGHT!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M1_D2":"Hold still!\n\nFor my next trick, I'm gonna make your head disappear!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M1_D4":"Hah! Looks like your tricks still need work! \n\nMaybe you should go back to the kiddies tent and work on them! ","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D1":"Arrgghh! Time to cut to the chase! \n\nTry to dodge this!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D2":"Dahlia, watch!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D3":"CLOAK... OF... DAGGERS!!!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D4":"No probl--","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D4a":"NO! VITALE!!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D6":"*Cerebella dives out of the ring, tackling Vitale as Beatrix's daggers whiz overhead*","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D7":"Vitale!? Are you okay?!","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D8":"Oof! The next time you save my life, perhaps do so with a little less gusto.","SD_Vignette05_C3_M2_D9":"Out of bounds, Cerebella. The match is over. \n\nCerebella has been disqualified. Beatrix is the winner.\n\nHow unsatisfying.","SD_Vignette05_C3_M3_D1":"OMG, Bella -- you OK? \n\nI\u2019m proud of you! You did the right thing.","SD_Vignette05_C3_M3_D2":"Th-Thanks Feng... hey, it\u2019s not like I need MORE work anyway. \n\nMain attraction of the Cirques des Cartes is a full-time job after all, right?","SD_Vignette05_C3_M3_D3":"That\u2019s the spirit!\n\nC'mon, how bout you treat me to that hot chocolate now, huh?","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D1":"Yes! I won! Hahaha - the prestige is finally MINE!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D2":"Dahlia, if I may... Cerebella was the one who risked everything to save me, not Beatrix (who put me in danger in the first place).","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D3":"Furthermore, unlike the rest of my employees, I didn\u2019t even have to ask. Seems she is the clear victor here.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D4":"...what?","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D5":"WHAT?!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D6":"Shocking.\n\nWell, you ARE the one writing the paychecks.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D8":"Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted! \n\nThank you, Vitale!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D9":"As for... Beatrix, is it? \n\nHere's a stack of casino chips for your... efforts.","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D10":"B-but, that\u2019s not fair! I won! I came out on top!","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D11":"Are you seriously playing the \"fairness\" card right now?","SD_Vignette05_C3_Outro_D12":"...","VignetteAct_06_Parasoul_Title":"No Shelter","VignetteAct_06_Parasoul":"Once upon a time, there was a desperate Queen who made a wish that would change the world...","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D0":"Canopolis, 8pm SHARP","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D1":"Umbrella, bedtime! \n\nNow, when we last left \"Annie: Girl of the Stars\" she was-","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D2":"Nooooo! \n\nI\u2019m way too old for those dumb Annie stories! She's such a lame, goody two-shoes.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D3":"Sigh. \n\nVery well, what story would you prefer?","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D4":"...How did Mom become the Skullgirl?","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D5":"...oh! W-wouldn't you rather something more fun? \n\nLike... why are Gigans so big? \n\nOr... how best to maintain an elite military in times of peace?","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D6":"NO! Everyone always acts all weird and coughs a lot whenever I ask about Mom! You're the ONLY person I can ask.\n\nBesides, you're all about honor and stuff - so you totally have to tell me!","SD_Vignette06_C1_Intro_D7":"...fine, fine. Where to begin\u2026 \n\nWell, seven years ago, there were three kingdoms at war with each other: ours, the Chess Kingdom and the Gigan Nation...","SD_Vignette06_C1_M1_D1":"Father had just come back from a peace conference between the three nations...","SD_Vignette06_C1_M1_D2":"Alas! Alack! My attempt at parlay was for naught.\n\nNow I fear this Grand War may NEVER end...","SD_Vignette06_C1_M1_D3":"Oh, sweet husband! I have continued my daily supplications at the cathedral without fail. Surely, if we trust in the Trinity, all our prayers will be answered.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M1_D4":"Would that it were so easy, dear Nancy, would that it were so easy.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M1_D5":"Truly this is our blackest hour. Let us cling together as we face this indomitable turmoil.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D1":"Ho! Perhaps I, Princess Parasoul, can be of assistance!","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D2":"My dear, sweet daughter. Although you are mature beyond your years, you are still far too young.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D3":"Indeed. Even though you have served as a beacon of hope to our people, received the best grades, and have always gone to bed and woken up on time--","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D4":"HEY! There's NO WAY they said that! You\u2019re making all this up!","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D5":"Do you want to hear the rest of this story or not?","SD_Vignette06_C1_M2_D6":"Yeah, but I asked about MOM, not YOU!\n\nNow get to the good stuff or I'm gonna start getting REAL salty.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D1":"Ahem. \n\nAs I was saying, things were dire and there was no help in sight. Mom had just about lost all hope, until one dark night, she met...","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D2":"I AM THE MYSTERIOUS AND ALL-POWERFUL SKULL HEART. I FLOAT BEFORE THEE WITH THE POWER TO GRANT ANY WISH YOU DESIRE, WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED WHATSOEVER.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D3":"WHAT IS IT YOU SEEK, ROYAL WOMAN?","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D4":"I\u2026 I wish for this war to finally end!","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D5":"IT SHALL BE DONE.","SD_Vignette06_C1_M3_D6":"Wait... what are you doing?!","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D2":"HAHAHA HOW NAIVE AND DESPERATE YOU MUST BE TO TRUST AN OMINOUS SKULL. \n\nIT SHALL BE YOUR UNDOING FOR NOW YOU MUST BECOME THE SKULLGIRL!","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D3":"No.... I... I must...","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D4":"I MUST DESTROY AND BE EVIL!","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D5":"...and so Mother was tricked into becoming the Skullgirl, and she was so powerful that ALL the kingdoms stopped fighting amongst themselves and banded together to defeat her.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D6":"Although it came at a great cost, in a sense, her wish was finally granted.\n\nThe end.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D7":"...wait, WHAT?! Mom just turned into the Skullgirl like that? I thought you only become the Skullgirl if you're impure?","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D7_2":"Also, I'm a little suspicious of this \"narrator\". Were you there watching the whole time or-","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D8":"Umbrella... you know the rules. \n\nI told you a story, now you have to go to sleep. We can talk more tomorrow.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D9":"Whatever...","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D10":"I love you, Umbrella.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D11":"...Love you too, sis.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D12":"Good night, princess.","SD_Vignette06_C1_Outro_D13":"Good night, princess.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D1":"Tiny Renoir may not have royal manner, but she know when sister is keeping secret.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D2":"She's not ready for the truth. Not until she's older.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D3":"Respectfully, Your Highness... everyone in the WORLD knows the truth. Would you rather she find out from them, or from you?","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D4":"I know... I plan to tell her soon.  \n\nAs soon as I know she's ready.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D5":"I know I wasn\u2019t...","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D6":"Seven years ago...","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D8":"Grand Cathedral, midnight.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D9":"All these years of prayers... all these years of promises...","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D10":"...I know a proper princess shouldn't stalk their Mother, but why would she go to the Grand Cathedral at this hour?","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D11":"*ominous chattering teeth*","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D12":"Get out of my way!","SD_Vignette06_C2_Intro_D13":"M-minions! But... but that means the Skullgirl is nearby!","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D1":"Show yourself, shapeshifter!","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D2":"Year after monstrous year has passed since I gave you my wish, yet nothing has changed - our people still suffer...","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D3":"Why?! Why has the war not ended as you promised?","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D4":"What? She doesn't mean...","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D6":"Answer me! Why have you done nothing? ANSWER ME!","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D7":"Because you were not pure of heart then, nor are you now.","SD_Vignette06_C2_M1_D8":"And so you will suffer the consequences.","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D1":"I only wanted what was best for my family and our kingdom...","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D2":"And yet you made your wish out of distrust for your husband.","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D3":"Despite his flaws, he is a good man...","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D4":"A \"good man\" who used a peace conference as a means to attack his enemies. \n\nYou knew of his ruthlessness. Deep down, you always knew it would end this way.","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D5":"I just thought\u2026 I wanted... ","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D6":"Mother...","SD_Vignette06_C2_M2_D7":"You may love your husband, Queen Nancy, but your love has poisoned everything you hold dear.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Outro_D1":"Very well. I shall not ask for forgiveness...","SD_Vignette06_C2_Outro_D2":"Good, for you would not receive it if you did.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Outro_D3":"If this is the only path to peace... I accept my fate.","SD_Vignette06_C2_Outro_D4":"Mother! What are you DOING?!","SD_Vignette06_C2_Outro_D5":"Parasoul?! Leave this place! RUN! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN! \n\nI\u2019m so sorry, I...

Amongst all the Skullgirls we've faced, Nancy is FAR beyond her predecessors. \n\nI'm afraid to say that the ASG labs were not prepared for an opponent of this magnitude.","SD_Vignette06_C3_Intro_D5":"Hah! You sure know how to pick 'em, eh Franz?\n\nIt is time for our final stand. Either we take her down, or all our kingdoms will share in glorious oblivion!

I can\u2019t distract her with my prattling forever!)","SD_Vignette06_C3_M3_D0":"Do you mean to stab me in the back like the others, husband? \n\nYou think I am cruel, but there is no deceit in my actions. Unlike some.","SD_Vignette06_C3_M3_D1":"Nancy... I'm not proud of everything I've done, but - like you - I have always acted with the best interest of the kingdom at heart.","SD_Vignette06_C3_M3_D2":"And yet those actions led our kingdom to war. Now you will finally know the consequences.\n\nAsh and ruin.","SD_Vignette06_C3_M3_D3":"You would do that to our people? Our daughters?","SD_Vignette06_C3_M3_D4":"Better me than your infernal war.

Tryin' to watch my weight.","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D1":"Not bad, not bad at all!","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D2":"You got moxie, I'll give you that, but I got eyes EVERYWHERE in this city. Literally.","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D3":"I seen you talkin' to those Egret stiffs about cleanin' up this city. \n\nYou wanna make things happen? The REAL action is here on the streets, not uptown with those mooks.","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D4":"You ain't got nothin' to worry about us. We're all on the straight and narrow here.\n\nHeck, we're practically angels... y'know, the real violent kind.","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D5":"You lookin' for a face to punch? Look no further than the MEDICI - they run the Casino, the Stadium, and every other shady racket in town, all from that fancy tower o' theirs.","SD_Act03_C2_Outro_D6":"You ever need a hand takin' 'em down, you know where to find me.\n\nAlthough with any luck, I'll have beat you to it!","Act_04_Show_Title":"Going All In","SD_Act04_C1_Intro_D1":"Thanks to your run-in with Peacock, it sounds like the Medici are up to something fishy at their River King Casino. \n\nFind me that something!","SD_Act04_C1_Intro_D2":"They're the deadliest crime organization in the city, but you know what they say, the biggest wins come from the steepest odds!","SD_Act04_C1_Intro_D3":"LOCATION: River King Casino\nPOPULATION: The Hopeful, the Hopeless, and the Medici who prey upon them both.\nMISSION: Sneak in and scrounge up some incriminating dirt!","SD_Act04_C1_Intro_D4":"Be careful! The Medici hire the toughest bodyguards - intel says their latest packs some serious muscle!","SD_Act04_C1_Intro_D5":"They'll see us coming from a mile away, so you'll need to find your own way there. \n\nGood luck, soldier.","SD_Act04_C1_MA1_D1":"Oh! Sorry, I'm not signing autographs right now.","SD_Act04_C1_MA1_D2":"What's that? Directions to the River King Casino?\n","SD_Act04_C1_MA1_D3":"Well sheesh, you're obviously new in town if you can't even recognize a bonafide celebrity!","SD_Act04_C1_MA1_D4":"I'm a performer in Cirque de Cartes - yes, THE Cirque de Cartes!","SD_Act04_C1_MA1_D5":"Surprisingly, it's a job that sends me all over town. \n\nI'm actually headin' back there myself - c'mon, I'll show you the way!","SD_Act04_C1_MA2_D1":"Y'know, I was just as clueless when I first arrived in town. Luckily, I also met someone who lent me a hand.","SD_Act04_C1_MA2_D2":"OK, we're about to cut through a rougher part of the neighborhood. Stay on your toes!","SD_Act04_C1_MA3_D1":"Well, well, well! Someone knows how to handle themselves!","SD_Act04_C1_MA3_D2":"Honestly, the streets aren't normally this bad.\n\nWe've got a real problem these days with random goons comin' out of the woodwork.","SD_Act04_C1_MA3_D3":"Speaking of which!","SD_Act04_C1_MA4_D1":"You were hired to help clean up New Meridian? No wonder you're so good at this!","SD_Act04_C1_MA5_D1":"We're almost there! \n\nDon't worry about me. If you saw my act at the circus, you'd know I don't mind cozyin' up to a little danger!","SD_Act04_C1_T1_D1":"It's like Vitale always says - \"Life doesn't owe you anything, so when it hands you a gift, take it and run!\"","SD_Act04_C1_T2_D1":"This is gonna sound weird, but you should always check inside these crates and barrels. One time I found a whole roast chicken just sitting in an oil drum! \n\nMint condition on a platter and everything!","SD_Act04_C1_Outro_D1":"Phew, we made it!","SD_Act04_C1_Outro_D2":"Hey, thanks back there. \n\nHere I was thinking I was doing YOU a favor, but you were doin' all the work! Classy!","SD_Act04_C2_Intro_D1":"You're going to be in the casino for a while, right? \n\nOK, let me see if I can get you free tickets to our show at the Cirque des Cartes.","SD_Act04_C2_Intro_D2":"Yeah, I know it's just a show - but hopefully it shows that there's more to life than just sockin' people in the streets.\n\nWe each gotta do our part to clean up the city, right?","SD_Act04_C2_Intro_D3":"Anyway, meet me under the giant whale in the middle of the Casino in about 2 hours - you can't miss it!","SD_Act04_C2_MA1_D1":"I swear, they might'a caught me off guard, y'know - 11 or 12 times - but they're gonna be real sorry the next time, 13's my lucky number!","SD_Act04_C2_MA1_D2":"Aw, an extra helping of bruisings builds character! \n\nAll part of a well-balanced Medici diet.","SD_Act04_C2_MA1_D3":"...aw heck, look who it is! \n\nYou'd best get ready for seconds!","SD_Act04_C2_MA2_D1":"So you're the one causing all that ruckus. This is a privately owned establishment, bozo. One way or another, you're leaving.","SD_Act04_C2_MA3_D1":"What's the hurry, stranger? \n\nIf you aren't here to play games, you'll lose a lot more than just money.","SD_Act04_C2_MA4_D1":"That's far enough. If you wanted to push your luck, you should have kept to the blackjack tables.","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D1":"Whoa, whoa! What are you guys doing?! We're all on the same team!","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D2":"You kiddin', Cerebella? This is the clown we told you 'bout who jumped us in Little Innsmouth!","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D3":"What!? But I-","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D4":"Sure as hell don't work for us - word is they're with the Egrets!","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D5":"Cripes... and I was gonna give you EXTREMELY reasonable seats and everything, too!","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D6":"Well, the tickets are off the table. But you're still about to see a star-filled performance!","SD_Act04_C2_MA5_D7":"Say hello to Cerebella and her living weapon Vice Versa, pride of the Medici muscle!","SD_Act04_C2_MA6_D1":"If the Royal Family had their way, there'd be no fun at all in this town.\n\nThe Medici having their hands in everything is why we've got any entertainment at all - including the Circus!","SD_Act04_C2_MA6_D2":"Yeah, the Egrets ain't no saints neither. Now scram!","SD_Act04_C2_MA7_D1":"You can stop playing the concerned citizen now and leave New Meridian to the proper authorities.","SD_Act04_C2_MA7_D2":"... in case you're slow on the uptick - that means us!","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D1":"Hm. Persistent, this one.\n\nNo doubt Cerebella regrets painting such a flattering picture of you.\n","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D2":"It's nothin', just some lousy newcomer who doesn't know how we do things around here. \n\nNobody's gonna make me look bad in front of you!","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D3":"Very well, my dear. \n\nI'm needed elsewhere, but do show our guest how we deal with... disrespect.","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D4":"No worries, Vitale, I've got this. \n\nSee you back at Medici Tower!","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D5":"\u2026um...\n\n...go easy on the name-dropping, will you?","SD_Act04_C2_MA8_D6":"They'll have trouble remembering their OWN name after I'm done with 'em.","SD_Act04_C2_T1_D1":"People say New Meridian is a pay-to-win city, but you and I both know that's not true.\n\nMoney gets you a seat at the table, sure, but you still have to EARN your reward.","SD_Act04_C2_T2_D1":"Enjoy the payout! \n\nWe'll get it all back soon enough...","SD_Act04_C2_Outro_D1":"Heh, alright - I suppose you're tougher than you look.","SD_Act04_C2_Outro_D2":"Too bad, stranger. That bought us enough time to get rid of anything that would be... problematic.","SD_Act04_C2_Outro_D3":"Yeah! So long as you don't frisk me for documents, you got nothin'!","SD_Act04_C2_Outro_D4":"Uh- hey, what're you doin'?! Stop!","Act_05_Woman_Title":"Ascent of a Woman","Act_Locked_Complete":"Complete {0} to Unlock","Act_Locked_Complete_Percent":"{0:0%} Complete {1} to Unlock","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D1":"That man you met in the Casino was Vitale Medici, second in command of the Medici Mafia. \n\nThanks to you we finally have enough reasonable suspicion to confront him and his cohorts.","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D2":"Naturally, they aren't being cooperative.\n\nVitale and his father, Lorenzo, are holed up in Medici Tower as we speak.","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D3":"They could be shredding evidence right now!\n\nIf we hurry, we can still use these building access codes we seized before they change 'em back!","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D4":"Or maybe I just knock. This hand particularly good for knocking.","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D5":"This is it. You've shown what you can do with small time hoodlums, but now we're taking on the head of the snake: Lorenzo Medici himself.\n\nThis time, we'll have your back.","SD_Act05_C1_Intro_D6":"Egrets, roll out!","SD_Act05_C1_MA1_D1":"It appears some loose lips have alerted the princess to our task at hand.","SD_Act05_C1_MA1_D2":"Y-yeah... if I ever find those screw-ups, I'll give them a piece of my mind!","SD_Act05_C1_MA1_D3":"Speaking of impossible tasks, your chance for redemption has arrived.\n\nI'll be with Lorenzo. Do NOT let them get to the Penthouse!","SD_Act05_C1_MA1_D4":"Don't worry, boss - we won't not let 'em get to the Penthouse!","SD_Act05_C1_MA1_D5":"Lawrence... how do you even SURVIVE out there?","SD_Act05_C1_MA2_D1":"Did you know the Medici Tower is over 100 stories tall? That gives us plenty of time to beat some sense into you.","SD_Act05_C1_MA3_D1":"I know the Medici have made a lot of enemies, but it ain't our fault that competition just seems to \"disappear\" whenever we show up.","SD_Act05_C1_MA3_D2":"It's even got a name: the Medici Effect! Here, see for yourself!","SD_Act05_C1_MA4_D1":"You again!  And hey, looks like you brought the cavalry.  \n\nIt ain't the first time Canopy soldiers invaded my home, but this time I'm armed and ready!","SD_Act05_C1_MA4_D2":"Wait... you're from No Man's Land?","SD_Act05_C1_MA4_D3":"Oh, I guess this must be weird for you, huh? \n\nSeeing someone who actually made it out alive?","SD_Act05_C1_MA4_D4":"I'm sorry about what happened.\n\nOur country made a lot of mistakes during the Grand War.","SD_Act05_C1_MA4_D5":"And here you are makin' another one!\n\nI'm not letting you take my new family, too!","SD_Act05_C1_MA5_D1":"We're here to prevent further wrongdoings. \n\nAre you aware what atrocities the Medici have been up to?","SD_Act05_C1_MA5_D2":"You think I'd trust a word comin' from YOU?!\n\nVitale's the one who took me in - \nI owe him everything!","SD_Act05_C1_MA6_D1":"What happen to your town was tragic and dark chapter of Canopy Kingdom.","SD_Act05_C1_MA6_D2":"But after much reform, Kingdom now strive for... how you say...","SD_Act05_C1_MA6_D3":"...the beefier good.","SD_Act05_C1_MA6_D4":"(The GREATER good)","SD_Act05_C1_MA6_D5":"Hmm. Still think it \"beefier,\" but if you say so.","SD_Act05_C1_MA7_D1":"You may not be able to telling, but I am actually naturalize citizen. If listen close, you may hear subtle accent.","SD_Act05_C1_MA7_D2":"I would not follow Princess if not believe in her, and not just because of hours of forced Canopy indoctrination film during many surgery.","SD_Act05_C1_MA7_D3":"Wait... they put you through what?!","SD_Act05_C1_MA7_D4":"Is all in past. Was also very competent filmmaking worthy of repeat viewing.\n\nA+++.

A little less cozy at home, I take it? Heh.","SD_Act05_C1_MBoss_D6":"Death eventually comes for us all, Lorenzo. \n\nNone of us can hide from it forever, no matter how tall your tower may be.","SD_Act05_C1_MBoss_D7":"Father - perhaps it's best not to antagonize...","SD_Act05_C1_MBoss_D8":"Am I dead yet?

I was just waiting for the right audience!","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D1":"Vitale\u2026 I'm sorry\u2026","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D2":"You fought bravely, my dear. Perhaps it's time to negotiate with the barbarians at the gate.\n\nThe Renoirs have always compromised when it benefitted them, after all.","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D3":"We're not the ones you should be worried about.\n\nYour arrogance is dragging our city into chaos, and if we don't stop it now, who knows what--","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D4":"ENOUGH! \n\nIf you even THINK you'll be able to pin anything on me in MY city, you're heading for a long drop and a sudden stop.","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D5":"*RUMBLE*","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D6":"Now what?!","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D7":"*WINDOWS SHATTER*","SD_Act05_C1_Outro_D8":"Lorenzo Medici.

They'll be souped up for the rest of the fight! \n\nRemember, every Character's Prestige Ability charges in different ways and does different things when activated. If you ever need help remembering how it all works, you can always PAUSE and do some recon.\n\nIf that wasn't snazzy enough, from now on using POWER UP or EVOLVE to upgrade your Fighters will automatically grant you whatever Skill Points you would have earned if you'd leveled 'em up to their max.\n\nAnyway!

Neither Renoir nor Medici will trample us again.","SD_Vignette08_C1_Outro_D12":"What's this? A muse speaks to me...\n\nYes! Can you not hear it?

I\u2019m still dead?","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D3":"Well... in a manner of speaking, yes. \n\nOn the bright side, as far as dead goes, I'd say you're doing rather better than most.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D4":"And... Mother's the Skullgirl?","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D5":"...\n\nForgive me, Sienna. I've failed you and your family in your time of greatest need.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D6":"Don't say that!

I think I am.\n\n...are zombies supposed to be able to think?","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D7":"Ordinarily\u2026 no. \n\nFrom time to time, certain minions brought back by the Skullgirl can exhibit aspects of their original personalities, but even then they are still under her control.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D8":"Stranger still, I should be weakening without a living host, yet in my current state... I dare say I feel stronger than ever. \n\nIt's all a bit puzzling.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D9":"It's all right, Leviathan. We both have some adjusting to do.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D10":"Maybe we can get some answers if we find Mother and Father.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D11":"Agreed. But Sienna, remember to keep your guard up. \n\nThere are Medici about.  Remember your defense lessons and follow my lead.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D12":"Very well. \n\nAnd Leviathan? Call me Squigly.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Intro_D13":"As you wish.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D1":"All this devastation\u2026 \n\nW-what is that? I can feel... something.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D2":"Look there! It\u2019s them!","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D3":"Lorenzo Medici. Your family's era is in its final act.\n\nCome, it is time for you join my rondo of blood. Embrace your oblivion.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D4":"Quite the contrary - my story is far from over.\n\nI can't imagine a more fitting crescendo for my legacy than to kill a Skullgirl and save MY city! You will be my greatest triumph.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D5":"Arrogant until the end. \n\nThis portrait you paint is simply of your own ruin.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D6":"And now I bet it's \"curtains\" for us, right?\n\nLet's get on with it. Less talking, more fighting.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D7":"Mother\u2026 She really is the Skullgirl...","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D8":"Now that we're so close, it's like I'm drawn to her... \n\nHer anger and her hate... I can feel it welling up inside...","SD_Vignette08_C2_M1_D9":"It's the Skull Heart! Because you were resurrected by your mother, you must be connected to it.\n\nDon't let it consume you, Squigly!","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D1":"Mother! Father! \n\nWhat are you doing?! Don't you see all the innocent people you're hurting?","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D2":"To the Medici, we are all disposable. Forever pawns in their grand game.\n\nThe Medici era will soon be over. These deaths are a small price to pay to ensure no one suffers at their hands ever again.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D3":"Daughter, we are timeless now. Take your place at my side and our family will rule this world together.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D4":"I\u2026 I know you\u2019re angry. Lorenzo and his family did terrible things...","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D5":"But this isn\u2019t the way to fix them, and I know you know that! \n\nWe don\u2019t hurt people!","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D6":"Hmph, the lament of the innocent. \n\nDo not dare to lecture me on right and wrong. Their injustices must not go unpunished.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M2_D7":"Now...\n\nJOIN. US.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D1":"I... I...","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D2":"Sienna Contiello! \n\nDo NOT make me ask you again.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D3":"No! Selene and Roberto would never wish their pain upon others!","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D4":"Listen to me, Squigly. That is not your mother's hatred but the Skull Heart's. Don't let it claim you, too!","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D5":"Ugh...  huh?\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in control! \n\nAre you doing this, Leviathan?","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D6":"I was only orating spontaneously, but... I think I am! \n\nThis is... unprecedented.","SD_Vignette08_C2_M3_D7":"Foolish girl.\n\nIt's time I taught you to properly respect your elders!","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D1":"I- I can\u2019t do it, Leviathan\u2026 \n\nHe\u2019s my father! I can\u2019t...","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D2":"That's my girl. Family first.\n\nCome, we\u2019ll--","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D3":"Did someone call for a tune up?!","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D4":"Who?!","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D5":"Is time to be making the noise!","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D6":"This isn\u2019t a time for quips, boys; let\u2019s just stop the big bad baddie.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D7":"You heard her, let's keep it professional.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D8":"This so-called opus of yours stops now, dead man. \n\nYou and your lady friend better dial it back from 11, otherwise you\u2019ll have to go through us! ","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D9":"Thank- thank you.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D10":"Relying on the help of strangers... Disregarding your family...","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D11":"It seems you are not fit to fight beside us after all.\n\nDo not return until you're ready to handle yourself with some dignity.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D12":"It seems the game has changed. \n\nCome Dahlia, we\u2019ll let these new players take over. For now.","SD_Vignette08_C2_Outro_D13":"Hmmph\u2026 Just when it was getting interesting\u2026","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D1":"I\u2026 Thank you again for your help. ...Who are you?","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D2":"Most proudest members of friendly neighborhood Anti-Skullgirls Labs.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D3":"Cogs in the Renoir warmachine\u2026","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D4":"If you say so, but this is our city, too. We don\u2019t wanna see it go down anymore than y\u2019all do. That ain't my tempo.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D5":"Thing is, we could use some help. Your momma\u2019s growing more powerful by the minute, and this ensemble is barely holding our own as it is.\n\nEven WITH an assist from a couple of \"concerned citizens\"...","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D6":"You could show a little more gratitude. \n\nIf we hadn\u2019t arrived when we did, you\u2019d just be another minion amongst the horde.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D7":"She\u2019s not wrong, but we have more important things to worry about than who saved whom. \n\nI know the two of you have been through a lot already, but the Skullgirl is everyone\u2019s problem. When one appears in a city this dense, things snowball out of control FAST.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D8":"But I saw you fighting down there. \n\nYour parents weren\u2019t out to kill you, and it sounds like you can use the Skullgirl's own power against her.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D9":"Parents that still recognize their children hold back, even leave themselves open\u2026","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D10":"NO! Out of the question! Absolutely not!","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D11":"Do you even understand what you are asking of her? \n\nWorking alongside usurpers is bad enough... but using her to do your dirty work?!","SD_Vignette08_C3_Intro_D12":"...","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D1":"Many report coming in! \n\nMinions are in the hunting of civilians!\n\nSkullgirl herself is hiding - likely she somewhere near Medici Tower, but too much chaos to be of knowing for certain.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D2":"Applesauce! Sounds like she's raising enough dead folk to give one helluva encore; this fight is going to consume the whole city.\n\nWe need to stop her - DOUBLE-TIME.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D3":"Listen, nobody here's gonna force you to do anything you don\u2019t wanna do. But we are going after her, with or without you.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D4":"...\n\nI'll do it.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D5":"It's\u2026 It\u2019s not just about us anymore. I could feel what was inside my mother - what she wants to do...\n\nI can find her, but she's not going to be alone. If you can help me get to her, maybe I can stop all of this.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D6":"Thanks, kid. Really. We all owe you one.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M1_D7":"If that is your decision, Squigly... You can count on me to have your back. \n\nAlways, no matter where it takes us...","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D1":"Look alive, folks! We're opening for Squigly tonight and it's a packed house! \n\nClear a path and don't let any of them charge the stage!","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D2":"Take them down quick and clean so we don\u2019t get overwhelmed.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D3":"Yes, ma\u2019am!","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D4":"Time for cracking bones and punching faces! \n\nBe careful, would be shame if you are to be dead again.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D5":"Ah, the prodigal daughter returns.\n\nAre you ready to take your place by our side as the Contiello you were born to be?","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D6":"No\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Father, but I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you and Mother do this.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D7":"Shameful. I clearly failed to raise you with the right values.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D8":"You didn't fail, old friend. That's why she's here and why I fight beside her.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M2_D9":"Now come and let us remind you what it truly means to be a Contiello!","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D1":"Didn\u2019t know\u2026 you had it in you...","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D2":"Goodbye, Father...","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D3":"Mother! I know you\u2019re here! Come out, please!","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D4":"Daughter... your first death has driven me to embrace this dark, glorious fate.\n\nDo not force me to watch you die a second time.\n","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D5":"I know I can\u2019t change your mind. I understand that now... But I can\u2019t just stand by and let you do this.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D6":"Don't you understand? With this power, the Contiello family will never be ripped asunder again! \n\nWe can sing forever. We can live forever...","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D7":"We have all made our choices, daughter, and you must now make yours.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D8":"I'd rather be dead than let our family become monsters.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D9":"Very well.\n\nHell's bells, you\u2019ve always been so stubborn.","SD_Vignette08_C3_M3_D10":"I guess it runs in the family.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D1":"No\u2026 No matter what... you fought for what you believed in\u2026 \n\nYou are a true heir\u2026 to the Contiello legacy...","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D2":"Goodbye... Mother...","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D3":"I\u2019m scared, Leviathan...  \n\nAfter all this, I...  I don't want to die...  Not again...","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D4":"I can feel it leaving me, too. Don't worry... you won't face this alone.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D5":"I\u2019ll always stay with you\u2026 I promise.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D6":"Thank... you...","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D7":"There are two types of people in this world. The ones who think they\u2019ll never lose, and the ones who know they will, but keep on fightin' anyway.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D8":"Sienna Contiello and Leviathan fought knowing their fate, and when the curtain fell, those two died smiling. They knew they had done their family proud.","SD_Vignette08_C3_Outro_D9":"After that, Panzer and I decided to keep what happened a secret from the labs.
